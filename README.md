# Image Creator Discord Bot
This code will help you for making a image generator bot for Discord using OpenAI API.

**How To Use?**

To use this code, you need a token for your Discord bot and API key from OpenAI. And of course you need an IDE for code. I recommend Visual Studio Code for you.

**Step 1: Creating A Bot in Discord**

First of all, you need to create an application for your bot. For this, visit [Discord Developer Portal Webpage](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
