# Image Creator Discord Bot
This code will help you for making a image generator bot for Discord using OpenAI API.

**How To Use?**

To use this code, you need a token for your Discord bot and API key from OpenAI. And of course you need an IDE for code. I recommend Visual Studio Code for you.

**Step 1: Creating A Bot in Discord**

First of all, you need to create an application for your bot. For this, visit [Discord Developer Portal Webpage](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

In this screen, you need to click to "New Application" button.

In this screen give a name to your app. I will use "AiImageCreator".

Then you click to "Create", this screen will come out.

There's some informations and customisations for our app. Don't forget to sharing your app id cause to bad things.

Here, press the three-lined button in the upper left corner of the screen. (I cut the three-lined button on the previous image accidentally. Sorry for that.)
